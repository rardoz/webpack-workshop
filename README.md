Webpack Workshop

## Setup
* Don't use yarn, super pointless
* Using node version 8.9.1 run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`
* Next navigate to `http://localhost:8080`


## Building for prod
* Run `npm run build`

Note: If you do this you need to run `npm run clear` before starting dev mode. Webpack dev server resolves compiled files first instead of virtual files. So you have to clear that stuff out or you wont see your changes in dev mode.
